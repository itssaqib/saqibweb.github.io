    This paper investigates the impact of terrorism on educational outcomes following the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The unexpected death of bin Laden, al-Qaeda’s founder and symbolic leader, triggered a significant escalation in retaliatory terrorist attacks. Terrorist groups perceived Pakistan as complicit in the U.S. operation, leading to increased attacks on government, military, and civilian targets, with assaults on educational institutions rising by 50 percent. This surge led to a significant decline in educational attainment, reducing average years of schooling by 0.52 years and lowering primary school completion rates by 5.9 percentage points, with a more pronounced impact on girls. Furthermore, academic performance declined, with math, English, and reading scores falling by approximately 0.1 standard deviations. These findings highlight that the elimination of a terrorist leader can incite retaliatory violence, significantly undermining the educational prospects of children, particularly girls.

            We leverage novel data extracted from weekly updated registers of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) centres to examine the impact of early access to land record information through digitization on dispute resolution outcomes in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Employing a quasi-experimental design, we estimate the causal effect of early access to Punjab Land Record Management Information System (PLRMIS) on the registration and resolution process of land-related disputes. Our results reveal that ADR centres in districts with early treatment experience an average increase of approximately 50 cases compared to those in districts with late treatment. By utilizing generalized multi-level mixed effect and two-stage least square models, we find that early implementation of PLRMIS significantly increases successful mediation outcomes by 126 cases in the treatment region with no effect on mediation failure cases. These findings provide compelling evidence for the pivotal role of PLRMIS in facilitating effective alternate dispute resolution, indicating increased public utilization of the system. Our results underscore the effectiveness of digitization and e-governance systems in improving land administration, reducing information asymmetry, and expediting the dispute resolution process.

Lowering exports is considered as one of the paramount reasons of widening trade deficit of Pakistan, which has become a long-standing challenge that country is facing since the beginning of the century. During the last two decades, the contribution of exports in GDP has been declined from 16 to 10 percent (World Bank, 2021). If we look at Pakistan’s share in global trade, it is dropped from 0.15 percent in 2005 to 0.12 percent in 2021. Export competitiveness of Pakistan is shrinking, while the competitors like Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam are experiencing expansion in export competitiveness. The stagnancy in Pakistan’s exports brings about a number of challenges like increasing current account deficit, burden of foreign debt, exchange rate, and other macroeconomic problems (Government of Pakistan, 2021-22; Defever, et al. 2020). Various reasons of declining export are suggested by the economists and researchers. To gather concrete evidence, a comprehensive desk review or literature review is required to unleash what factors are bringing down Pakistan’ exports. For that purpose, the underlying piece of research aims to weave up a review of existing literature on exports and unfolds the significant factors which influence exports.

Over the last three decades, the environment has become a hotly discussed topic all over the world. The United Nations has set up seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve a standard of sustainable practices in the world including both developed and developing countries. Among these goals, the environment is regarded as a primary concern for all countries. The purpose of this research is to identify potential environmental indicators and challenges in organizational settings. This paper specifically investigates the impact of sustainable leadership on the environment, both directly and indirectly, through environmental practices and sustainable culture. Using a sample of 306 organizational personnel and Partial Least Square (PLS) Structural Equation Model (SEM), the results reveal that Sustainable Leadership (SL) have a significant impact on environmental sustainability. The results also indicate that Environmental Practices (EP) and Sustainable Culture (SC) influence Green Performance (GP). Findings of this study reinforce the organization’s concern for environmental sustainability and suggest how organizations and institutions can improve the environment through sustainable leadership. This is the first research to not only empirically study the interaction of SL and GP, but also to throw light on the existing literature by investigating the mediating function of environmental practices and sustainable culture and the underlying relationship.

            In this book theory of well-being is used in all scenarios and the most focused variable was the ultimate well-being, that generates occasions for well-being and happiness (Haybron and Tiberius 2015; Helliwell et al. 2016)) of people. Particularly this book is based on MENA – the Middle East and North Africa. MENA has gained significant importance by scholars and media at international level after the event of Sep 11, 2001, 2008’s financial crisis, spring of 2011 in Arab. Each event has highly effected the politics, societies and wellbeing of people.
