This paper examines the political consequences of terrorism in Pakistan. We exploit the death of Osama bin Laden as an instrumental variable for terrorist attacks and use quasi-random variation between successful and failed attacks across regions. Using candidate- and constituency-level electoral data, we find that successful terrorist attacks significantly increase the vote share of left-wing populist and independent candidates, while reducing support for right-wing parties. These findings suggest how terrorism can reshape the political landscape by shifting voter preferences toward populist alternatives.
