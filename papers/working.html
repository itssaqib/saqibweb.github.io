I use high-frequency, incident-level corruption data, combined with agricultural credit and land use datasets, to estimate the impact of land record digitization. Exploiting the phased implementation of digitization as a natural experiment and using deviations in its rollout as an instrumental variable, I find an increase in documentation of corruption complaints by 29.35 percent per million population while reducing enquiries and cases by 40.66 percent and 31.71 percent, respectively, indicating early resolution of disputes due to improved transparency. Civil case registrations at the Lahore High Court also increased, accompanied by higher mediation success rates. Additionally, access to agricultural credit improved significantly for small farmholders and non-farm holders, while no effect was observed for above-economic holdings. Land use patterns showed an increase in cropped and sown areas, reflecting enhanced agricultural productivity. I find transparency as the primary mechanism driving these effects, as digitization reduces information asymmetry and limits opportunities for corruption by increasing public access to reliable land records. A game-theoretic model is proposed to explain how transparency influences bureaucratic behavior and citizen engagement. Robustness checks using intent-to-treat and local average treatment effect analyses confirm the consistency of results across various specifications. These findings highlight the transformative potential of e-governance reforms in improving state capacity, fostering accountability, and promoting inclusive development. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for scaling similar interventions in other regions to enhance governance outcomes.
