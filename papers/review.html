This paper estimates the impact of terrorist attacks on electoral and socioeconomic outcomes in Pakistan. Leveraging exogenous variation from the Red Mosque siege and the death of Osama bin Laden, I show that these events increased attacks 3.5 times, reducing voter turnout by five percentage points and lowering incumbents’ reelection prospects. Attacks also decreased education and labor market outcomes, particularly in low-turnout areas. I identify mechanisms through migration, religious extremism, media exposure, democratic preference for Sharia law, and fear, rather than institutional breakdown. The findings highlight how terrorism shapes both political behavior and development in fragile democracies.

This paper answers the question, “When Terrorists Attack?”, by estimating the impact of terrorism on employment in Pakistan. Since terrorists choose their targets strategically, difference-in-differences-type estimators are biased. To address this, I use the death of Osama bin Laden and the Red Mosque siege as instrumental variables for attacks. I find that attacks reduce employment by 7.4 percentage points—a more pronounced and significant effect than what is predicted by difference-in-differences. I also find that terrorists target areas experiencing positive economic shocks. Using a unique set of datasets, I uncover several underlying mechanisms, including media exposure, extremism, pro-sharia sentiment, migration, soft targets, development, and education. The findings are heterogeneous by gender, area, industry, and occupation type. Tests for exclusion restriction, instrument validity, robustness, placebo, and falsification are consistent across specifications.

This paper uses the 2005 Pakistan earthquake as a natural experiment and estimates its long-term effects on human capital development. Exposure to the earthquake was plausibly exogenous for individuals born after the disaster. We exploit variation across birth cohorts and districts affected by the earthquake. We find that cohorts exposed to the earthquake exhibit higher rates of disabilities, lower educational attainment, and worse labor market outcomes. We also find that migration prior to the earthquake mitigated its impact on disabilities. The effects are more pronounced for cognitive disabilities, girls, and individuals from low-education and low-income households. These findings highlight the importance of migration and targeted investments in affected cohorts to improve long-term human capital outcomes.

Terrorism, Mental Health and Labor Market

This paper examines the impact of exposure to terrorism on mental health and labor market outcomes in the United States, focusing on the unexpected 9/11 attack. Using data from the Global Terrorism Database and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys, we find that exposure to terrorism is associated with diminished mental health, which in turn is associated with adverse labor market outcomes, including employment and income. However, we do not find any significant effects on physical health or overall health. Our findings show heterogeneous effects across gender, income, race, and ethnicity, with women and high-income individuals experiencing the most significant impacts. These results suggest the need for mental health interventions and economic support policies to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of terrorism exposure.
